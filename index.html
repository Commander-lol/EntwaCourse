                        This document is structured specifically to enable easy machine extraction of arbitrary sections.

                        processed equally, as well as ensuring that the same processes performed on different versions
                        of this document provide the same data (so long as the data is not the subject of a modification).

                                    <strong>Heading</strong> content should be set in 700 weight Roboto Slab font or an alternative Serif 
                                    font if Roboto Slab is unavailable.

                                    <strong>Body</strong> content should be set in 400 weight Open Sans font, with bold elements using a weight
                                    of 700 and italic elements using a weight of 300 in addition to italics hinting, or an alternative
                                    Sans-Serif font if Open Sans is unavailable.

                                    <strong>Code</strong> elements and elements that denote <strong>user input</strong> should be set in 400
                                    weight Cousine font with an aliceblue (<code>#F0F8FF</code>) background at the same font size as surrounding content,
                                    or with an alternative Monospace font if Cousine is unavailable.

                            <strong>Sections:</strong> Every numbered section (regardless of depth) should be entirely contained within one 
                            <code>section</code> element within the <code>main</code> container element. The first child of
                            each <code>section</code> should be an appropriate heading element, and may be followed by any valid content.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Headings: </strong> An appropriate heading is a <code>h-</code> element where <code>-</code> is
                                    a number from 2 to 6 denoting the depth of the section. Sections in the root of <code>main</code> are
                                    indexed at 2, with this number being incremented once for every additional containing <code>section</code>.
                                    The first content of the heading element must be an <code>a</code> anchor tag with an <code>id</code> that
                                    is referenced by a corresponding anchor in the contents list. The anchor tag must only contain the associated
                                    full section number as present in the contents page. The remaining contents can include any valid inline elements
                                    (including raw text).
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Contents: </strong>All items following the heading should be valid block level sectioning or content
                                    elements (e.g. <code>div</code>, <code>p</code>, others). A numbered sectioning element <em>must not</em> contain
                                    any inline elements such as <code>span</code> or <code>strong</code> - these should be within block level elements
                                    so as to preserve semantic meaning and better enable machine interpretation by sensibly delimiting blocks of 
                                    related content.

                    <p>
                        Proposed revisions to this document must be created in a copy of this file seperate to the 'mainline' working copy. A Unix compliant
                        diff file (standard output from the Unix diff utility) of the changes from the current mainline version must the be sent to the Design
                        Authority alongside a written log of changes. Once accepted, the changes will be patched into the mainline version and subsequently
                        added to the table of changes in section 5.3.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The exception to this rule is the updating of milestone status markers. In order to update the status of a milestone, the implementer must
                        send relevant proof of changed status in addition to a corroboration by all members of the Development Team to the Design Authority (where
                        "relevant proof" is simply any relevant object that has sufficiently convinced the Development Team to give its unanimous approval for
                        the status change). If the change is accepted, the status will be updated and a record will be added to section 5.4 alongside the <em>date
                        of approval</em>. If appropriate the provided proof will be added as an appendix to this document.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>N.B:</strong> The addition of a diff file to section 5.3 is not considered a change that requires a published diff to be added to
                        the table, as doing so would cause a recursive cascade. As a result, the diff will be added and that patched version will be
                        considered the mainline version. If this procedure is followed correctly for subsequent changes, any changes to section 5.3 will not appear
                        in any diff files.
