                        Develop a service that allows MSc students and entities
                        external to the university to submit, manage and search project ideas. It should also allow
                        unit lecturers to comment upon the submitted ideas, as well as become assigned to one or more projects. The
                        core functionalities should closely resemble the <a href="http://www.sums.port.ac.uk/spi/" nofollow>existing

                    <p>
                        In order to allow a longer period between the creation of this software and a replacement being commisioned,
                        certain elements are being taken into consideration. Primarily, the software is being created in an MVC style
                        to promote reuse and easy modification of code. Such a style also enables extensibility by conforming to a
                        predictable pattern - if the university wishes to expand upon this software in the future, an MVC style lends
                        itself to this purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Further to this, usage of modern APIs and frameworks means that the software conforms to current standards,
                        and should therefore age better than an equivelant software written using older packages - if any given
                        library has a usable lifespan of 4 years, it follows that using a modern library will give more life to
                        the project than a legacy one.

                    <h3><a id="Introduction-Rationale">1.4.</a> Rationale for Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        There is a current (previously mentioned) system in place that provides many of the functions that are listed
                        here. There are, however, some flaws that have prompted the creation of this new version. The largest missing
                        feature from the current implementation is the ability for students to easily manage their SUMs profiles and
                        propsed project ideas; once submitted, an idea must be completely resubmitted in order to respond to feedback
                        and cannot be changed in place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are also many concerns about the UX of the site, which will be addressed by this new version (see the
                        milestones for implementation stages of UX improvements).

                            <code>section</code> element within the <code>main</code> container element. The first child of
                            each <code>section</code> should be an appropriate heading element, and may be followed by any valid content.
                            <ul>
                                <li>

                                        <strong>Headings: </strong> An appropriate heading is a <code>h-</code> element where <code>-</code> is
                                        a number from 2 to 6 denoting the depth of the section. Sections in the root of <code>main</code> are
                                        indexed at 2, with this number being incremented once for every additional containing <code>section</code>.
                                        The first content of the heading element must be an <code>a</code> anchor tag with an <code>id</code> that
                                        is referenced by a corresponding anchor in the contents list. The anchor tag must only contain the associated
                                        full section number as present in the contents page. The remaining contents can include any valid inline elements
                                        (including raw text).

                                        <strong>Contents: </strong>All items following the heading should be valid block level sectioning or content
                                        elements (e.g. <code>div</code>, <code>p</code>, others). A numbered sectioning element <em>must not</em> contain
                                        any inline elements such as <code>span</code> or <code>strong</code> - these should be within block level elements
                                        so as to preserve semantic meaning and better enable machine interpretation by sensibly delimiting blocks of
                                        related content.

                    <p>
                        Proposed revisions to this document must be created in a copy of this file seperate to the 'mainline' working copy. A Unix compliant
                        diff file (standard output from the Unix diff utility) of the changes from the current mainline version must the be sent to the Design
                        Authority alongside a written log of changes. Once accepted, the changes will be patched into the mainline version and subsequently
                        added to the table of changes in section 5.3.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The exception to this rule is the updating of milestone status markers. In order to update the status of a milestone, the implementer must
                        send relevant proof of changed status in addition to a corroboration by all members of the Development Team to the Design Authority (where
                        "relevant proof" is simply any relevant object that has sufficiently convinced the Development Team to give its unanimous approval for
                        the status change). If the change is accepted, the status will be updated and a record will be added to section 5.4 alongside the <em>date
                        of approval</em>. If appropriate the provided proof will be added as an appendix to this document.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>N.B:</strong> The addition of a diff file to section 5.3 is not considered a change that requires a published diff to be added to
                        the table, as doing so would cause a recursive cascade. As a result, the diff will be added and that patched version will be
                        considered the mainline version. If this procedure is followed correctly for subsequent changes, any changes to section 5.3 will not appear
                        in any diff files.
